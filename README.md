# AUTOMATIC LICENSE PLATE DETECTION

This project proposes a method for the detection and identification of vehicle number plate that will help in the detection of number plates of authorized and unauthorized vehicles. This project presents an approach based on simple but efficient morphological operation and an edge detection method. This approach is simplified to segment all the letters and numbers used in the number plate by using bounding box method.
